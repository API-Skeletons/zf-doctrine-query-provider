zf-doctrine-query-provider
==========================

Integrate [Doctrine in Apigility](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-doctrine) Query Providers into Doctrine Repositories.

This allows you to fetch entities using the same business logic and filtering your Query Providersuse.  Useful for RPC where an entity may be required and must have access to the current user.
